                            Becoming India's no. 1 fashion destination is not an easy feat. Sincere efforts, digital
                            enhancements and a team of dedicated personnel with an equally loyal customer base have made
                            Myntra the online platform that it is today. The original B2B venture for personalized gifts
                            was conceived in 2007 but transitioned into a full-fledged ecommerce giant within a span of
                            just a few years. By 2012, Myntra had introduced 350 Indian and international brands to its
                            platform, and this has only grown in number each passing year. Today Myntra sits on top of
                            the online fashion game with an astounding social media following, a loyalty program
                            dedicated to its customers, and tempting, hard-to-say-no-to deals.
